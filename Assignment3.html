		<h1>Different Styles of Motorcycles</h1>
		<p>There are many types of motorcycles. For each type of motorcycle there are often many sub models. The primary types are Cruisers, Touring, Sport, and Dirt or Offroad. We will discuss a little about each type and their sub models. The purpose here is to see the pros and cons of each, and how they fit intended usage. This discussion isnâ€™t about which one is better, or which brand is best, or what the style of bike you choose says about your personality or attitude, or which bike we think you should buy.</p>

	<h3>Cruisers</h3>
		<p>Cruisers is a general description of the what you are most likely to see. The style is the name. All bikes have the same basic equipment: Handlebars, foot pegs, seats. In a cruiser these are all set up for cruising, riding around on empty backroads, or freeways without heavy stop and go traffic.</p>

	<h6>Touring</h6>
		<p>Touring bikes are also named after their function. These bikes are configured with lots of extra storage for long trips, or tours if you will. They often have navigation systems and radios referred to as infotainment systems. They also are equipped with cruise control, just like your car!</p>
